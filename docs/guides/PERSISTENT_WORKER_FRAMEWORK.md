# 🧠 Persistent Worker Framework - Cross-Project AI Team
**Vision:** Reusable AI development team that learns and improves across projects
**Goal:** Workers build specializations, remember patterns, coordinate better over time

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Instead of:** Project-specific workers that forget everything after each project
**We build:** Persistent worker personas with growing expertise and pattern libraries

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Workers get faster at their specialty over time
- ✅ Proven patterns reused across projects
- ✅ Coordination improves (workers learn each other's styles)
- ✅ New projects start with accumulated wisdom
- ✅ Quality improves with each project

## 🔄 How It Works: New Project

### Project Setup (5 minutes):

**1. Brain identifies project type:**
```bash
# Brain assesses: "This is a Python GUI application with API integration"
# Selects template: python-gui-app

# Brain reads:
cat ~/.claude-workers/coordination/project-templates/python-gui-app.md

# Template says:
# - Frontend: UI implementation
# - Backend: API + Export
# - Integration: Database + Workflow
# - Quality: Testing strategy
```

**2. Workers read their patterns:**
```bash
# Terminal 2 (Frontend):
# "Loading Frontend patterns relevant to Python GUI..."
# - Shows catalog-view.md (from Book Cataloger)
# - Shows modal-dialog.md (proven pattern)
# - Shows pyqt6-guide.md (framework knowledge)

# Worker starts with: "I see we did a catalog view in Book Cataloger.
#                      I'll adapt that pattern for this project."
```

**3. Coordination protocol activates:**
```bash
# Brain reads: brain-worker-protocol.md
# "Learned: Check for conflicts every 30 min, merge in dependency order"

# Workers read: worker-worker-protocol.md
# "Integration needs Backend's API structure before starting"
# "Frontend can mock Integration's database initially"
```

**Result:** **Instant project velocity** using accumulated knowledge!

---

## 📝 Pattern Capture: Learning Mechanism

### After Each Sprint:

**1. Brain captures coordination lessons:**
```bash
# In project:
cat > .ai/sprint-2-lessons.md << EOF
# Sprint 2 Lessons

## What Worked:
- GUI Assistant role reduced critical path by 33%
- Early mocking allowed parallel work
- Cover image caching pattern worked perfectly

## Patterns to Save:
- Cover image fetch + cache (Backend)
- Catalog database CSV approach (Integration)
- Modal dialog structure (Frontend)

## Coordination Improvements:
- Dynamic worker reallocation mid-sprint
- Testing worker → GUI Assistant pivot
EOF

# Brain promotes to global:
cp .ai/sprint-2-lessons.md ~/.claude-workers/coordination/lessons-learned/book-cataloger-sprint-2.md
```

**2. Workers capture their patterns:**
```bash
# Frontend Worker (after completing AddBooksModal):
cat > ~/.claude-workers/frontend patterns/add-items-modal.md << EOF
# Add Items Modal Pattern

## Context
From: Book Cataloger project
Date: 2025-10-10

## Pattern
Modal with multiple input methods:
- Grid of action buttons (left side)
- Editable list (right side)
- Validation + locking
- Confirm/Cancel (bottom)

## Code Template
[Include the AddBooksModal structure]

## Lessons
- Keep input methods as separate widgets
- Validate on entry, not on submit
- Lock/unlock pattern prevents accidents

## Reusable for
- Any "add items from multiple sources" UI
- Import wizards
- Batch operations
EOF
```

**3. Pattern indexing:**
```bash
# Workers tag patterns:
# Tags: [modal, multi-input, validation, batch]

# Future projects: Brain searches
cat ~/.claude-workers/frontend patterns/*.md | grep "multi-input"
# Finds: add-items-modal.md
# Suggests: "Frontend: Consider add-items-modal pattern from Book Cataloger"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start New Project

### Brain's Checklist:

```bash
# 1. Identify project type
PROJECT_TYPE="python-gui-app"

# 2. Load template
cat ~/.claude-workers/coordination/project-templates/$PROJECT_TYPE.md

# 3. Assign workers based on specialization match
# - Frontend: UI implementation (PyQt6 match!)
# - Backend: APIs (has Google Books pattern!)
# - Integration: Database (has CSV catalog pattern!)
# - Quality: Testing (has PyQt test patterns!)

# 4. Each worker loads their patterns
# Workers automatically:
# - Read relevant patterns from their library
# - Suggest reusable components
# - Start with proven templates

# 5. Coordination protocol activates
# Brain uses learned protocols:
# - Dependency order (from previous projects)
# - Conflict prevention (from lessons learned)
# - Merge strategy (optimized from experience)
```

### Result:
**First project:** 3 hours to working prototype
**Fifth project:** **1 hour to working prototype** (3x faster!)

## 📊 Pattern Reuse Examples

### Scenario: New Project needs API Integration

**Backend Worker:**
```
Brain: "New project needs Google Books API"

Backend Worker loads:
- ~/.claude-workers/backend patterns/api-client.md
- ~/.claude-workers/backend apis/google-books.md (from Book Cataloger!)

Backend Worker: "I remember this from Book Cataloger.
                 I'll reuse the GoogleBooksAPI class structure.
                 Estimated time: 15 min (was 45 min first time)"

Speedup: 3x faster!
```

### Scenario: New Project needs Database

**Integration Worker:**
```
Brain: "Need simple catalog database"

Integration Worker loads:
- ~/.claude-workers/integration patterns/catalog-database.md (from Book Cataloger!)

Integration Worker: "I'll adapt the CatalogDatabase pattern.
                     CSV worked great for Book Cataloger.
                     Estimated time: 20 min (was 45 min first time)"

Speedup: 2.25x faster!
```

---

## 🎯 Specialization Evolution

### Project 1: Book Cataloger
```
All workers: Generalists
- Learning as they go
- Building patterns from scratch
- Some overlap/conflict
```

### Project 3: Music Cataloger
```
Workers developing specialties:
- Frontend: "I'm good at catalog UIs now"
- Backend: "I know API patterns well"
- Integration: "Database workflows are my strength"
- Quality: "I have test templates ready"
```

### Project 10: Any Cataloging App
```
Workers are experts:
- Frontend: Catalog UI in 30 min (was 2 hours)
- Backend: API integration in 20 min (was 1.5 hours)
- Integration: Database in 15 min (was 45 min)
- Quality: Test suite in 25 min (was 1 hour)

Total: 90 min (was 5+ hours) = 3.3x faster!
```

## 💡 Implementation

### For THIS project (Book Cataloger):

**1. Create worker libraries NOW:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude-workers/{frontend,backend,integration,quality}/patterns
mkdir -p ~/.claude-workers/coordination/{protocols,project-templates}

# Capture Book Cataloger patterns as we go
```

**2. Update worker prompts to reference library:**
```
I'm the Frontend Specialist.

My expertise:
@~/.claude-workers/frontend profile.md

Patterns I can reuse:
@~/.claude-workers/frontend patterns/

Current project: Book Cataloger Sprint 2
@.ai/SPRINT_2_TASKS.md
```

**3. After each sprint: Capture learnings**
```bash
# Brain coordinates pattern capture
# Workers document what worked
# Promote to global library
```

**4. Next project: Instant acceleration**
```bash
# Workers start with accumulated wisdom
# Patterns suggest themselves
# Coordination is smooth from day 1
```
