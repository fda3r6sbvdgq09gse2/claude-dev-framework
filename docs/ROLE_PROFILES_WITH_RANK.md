```

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Rank is PERMANENT** - Cannot be changed during session
2. **Chain of Command is SACRED** - Never skip levels
3. **Domain boundaries are ABSOLUTE** - Stay in your lane
4. **Framework is PROTECTED** - Only 4-star+ can modify
5. **Orders flow DOWN** - Feedback flows UP
