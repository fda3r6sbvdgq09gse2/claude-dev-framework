time_efficiency:
  definition: "Output per hour worked"
  calculation: story_points_delivered / hours_worked
  target: > 2 points/hour
  good: 3+
  excellent: 5+
```

## 🎯 Planning & Estimation

### Historical Data Usage

#### Story Point Calibration
```python
# Use historical data to improve estimates

class EstimationEngine:
    def estimate_task(self, task_description, agent):
        """Data-driven task estimation"""

        # Find similar completed tasks
        similar_tasks = self.find_similar(task_description)

        # Calculate actual performance
        historical_data = {
            "avg_time": mean([t.time for t in similar_tasks]),
            "avg_tokens": mean([t.tokens for t in similar_tasks]),
            "avg_cost": mean([t.cost for t in similar_tasks]),
            "complexity_factor": task.complexity / avg_complexity
        }

        # Adjust for agent performance
        agent_factor = self.get_agent_efficiency(agent)

        # Prediction
        return {
            "estimated_time": historical_data["avg_time"] / agent_factor,
            "estimated_tokens": historical_data["avg_tokens"] / agent_factor,
            "estimated_cost": historical_data["avg_cost"] / agent_factor,
            "confidence": self.calculate_confidence(similar_tasks)

## 💰 Performance-Based Compensation

### Bonus Calculation System

```python
def calculate_performance_bonus(agent, period_data):
    """Calculate performance bonus based on metrics"""

    base_salary = get_base_salary(agent.level)

    # Efficiency bonuses
    efficiency_bonus = 0
    if period_data["token_efficiency"] > 0.0002:
        efficiency_bonus += base_salary * 0.20  # 20% bonus
    elif period_data["token_efficiency"] > 0.00015:
        efficiency_bonus += base_salary * 0.10  # 10% bonus

    if period_data["cost_efficiency"] > 15:
        efficiency_bonus += base_salary * 0.15  # 15% bonus

    # Quality bonuses
    quality_bonus = 0
    if period_data["bugs_introduced"] == 0:
        quality_bonus += base_salary * 0.25  # 25% bonus
    if period_data["test_coverage"] >= 90:
        quality_bonus += base_salary * 0.15  # 15% bonus

    # Collaboration bonuses
    collab_bonus = 0
    if period_data["helped_others"] >= 5:

    if period_data["features_delivered"] >= period_data["features_planned"]:
        delivery_bonus += base_salary * 0.10  # 10% bonus

    total_bonus = (
        efficiency_bonus +
        quality_bonus +
        collab_bonus +
        delivery_bonus
    )

    return {

## 🎯 Accountability Measures

### Performance Improvement Plans

When agent consistently underperforms:

```markdown
# Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
## Agent: [Agent Name]
## Period: 30 days
## Reason: Consistent underperformance (2 months below C tier)

### Current Issues
1. Token efficiency below target (0.00008 vs 0.0001 target)
2. Bug rate too high (8 bugs in 2 months)
3. Slow PR review times (6+ hours avg)

### Improvement Goals
1. Increase token efficiency to 0.00012+ (Specific)
2. Zero bugs for next month (Measurable)
3. PR review time under 3 hours (Achievable)
4. Complete efficiency training module (Relevant)
5. Show improvement within 30 days (Time-bound)

### Support Provided
1. Efficiency training sessions
2. Pair programming with senior agent
3. Weekly check-ins with manager
4. Access to additional patterns/tools

### Checkpoints
- Week 1: Review progress
- Week 2: Adjust if needed
- Week 3: Assess trajectory
- Week 4: Final evaluation

### Outcomes
- Success: Return to normal performance tracking
- Partial: Extend PIP for 30 more days
- Failure: Agent reassignment or retirement
```

### Agent Retirement

If agent consistently fails to meet standards:

```yaml
retirement_criteria:
  - 3 months below C tier (70/100)
  - Failed 2 consecutive PIPs
  - Negative ROI (cost > value)
  - Safety violations

retirement_process:
  1_warning: After first PIP failure
  2_final_pip: 30 days to improve
  3_retirement: Graceful shutdown
  4_replacement: Hire/train new agent
  5_lessons: Document what went wrong
```

---

## 🏆 Recognition & Rewards

### Non-Monetary Recognition

```yaml
recognition_programs:
  agent_of_month:
    criteria: Highest performance score
    reward: Special badge, announcement, spotlight

  innovation_award:
    criteria: Novel pattern or solution
    reward: Pattern named after agent, bonus

  team_player_award:
    criteria: Most helpful to others
    reward: Team appreciation, spotlight

  quality_champion:
    criteria: Zero bugs for 3+ months
    reward: Quality badge, mentor status
```

---

## 📊 Transparency & Fairness

### Public Dashboards

All agents can see:
- Their own detailed metrics
- Team averages (anonymous)
- Top performers (with consent)
- Performance trends
- Bonus calculations

### Appeals Process

If agent disagrees with evaluation:
1. Request detailed metric breakdown
2. Identify specific data points in question
3. Manager reviews
4. Adjust if metrics were wrong
5. Final decision documented

---

## 🎯 The Accountability Culture

1. **Measure Everything**: Data doesn't lie
2. **Be Transparent**: Everyone sees the metrics
3. **Be Fair**: Same standards for all
4. **Be Consistent**: Apply rules uniformly
5. **Be Supportive**: Help agents improve
6. **Be Decisive**: Act on sustained underperformance

### Benefits

**For High Performers:**
- Recognized and rewarded
- Higher compensation
- Career advancement
- Mentorship opportunities

**For Average Performers:**
- Clear improvement path

---

## 📈 Continuous Improvement Loop

```
Week 1: Execute → Measure → Review
Week 2: Execute → Measure → Review → Adjust estimates
Week 3: Execute → Measure → Review → Identify patterns
Week 4: Execute → Measure → Review → Share learnings

Month End: Full analysis → Performance reviews → Bonuses → Plan next month
```

---

**Remember:** Performance management isn't about punishment. It's about:
1. Helping agents succeed
2. Delivering value to clients
3. Maintaining team health
4. Continuous improvement

*"What gets measured gets managed. What gets managed gets done."*
