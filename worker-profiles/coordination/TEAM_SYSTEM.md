# üéÆ Team Composition System - Pokemon-Style Worker Evolution

**Concept:** Workers are like Pokemon - they build experience, evolve, have different strengths/weaknesses, and combine into teams optimized for specific project types.

**Vision:** Deploy specialized teams across multiple projects in parallel!

## üéØ Team Selection Algorithm

### Input: Project Requirements
```yaml
Project: Music Library App
Type: Desktop GUI
Tech: Python, PyQt6
Features:
  - GUI (complex catalog view)
  - Audio file metadata
  - Playlist management
  - Export to CSV/XML
  - Album artwork caching

Estimated Complexity: Medium
Timeline: 2 weeks
```

### Team Selection Process

**1. Identify Required Specializations:**
- Frontend (PyQt6) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Backend (file I/O, export, caching) - MEDIUM
- Integration (catalog database, playlists) - MEDIUM
- Quality (testing) - LOW

**2. Match Workers by Experience:**
```python
# Pseudo-algorithm
def select_team(project):
    requirements = analyze_project(project)

    # Find best Frontend worker for PyQt6
    frontend = find_best_worker(
        specialization="Frontend",
        required_skills=["PyQt6", "Catalog View"],
        min_level=2
    )
    # Result: Alice (Level 3, PyQt6: 95/100)

    # Find best Backend for this project
    backend = find_best_worker(
        specialization="Backend",
        required_skills=["Caching", "Export"],
        min_level=2
    )
    # Result: Bob (Level 4, Caching: 82/100)

    # Check team synergy
    synergy = calculate_synergy(frontend, backend)
    # Alice + Bob = 100% synergy!

    # Complete team
    team = {
        "Frontend": Alice (Lvl 3),
        "Backend": Bob (Lvl 4),
        "Integration": Ian (Lvl 3),
        "Quality": Quinn (Lvl 2)
    }

    # Calculate expected performance
    base_time = estimate_project_time(project)  # 40 hours
    team_bonus = calculate_team_bonus(team)      # 1.3x (Book Cataloger experience)
    synergy_bonus = calculate_synergy_bonus(team)  # 1.1x

    estimated_time = base_time / (team_bonus * synergy_bonus)
    # 40 / (1.3 * 1.1) = 27.9 hours

    return team, estimated_time
```

**3. Output: Recommended Team**
```
‚úÖ Team A (Python GUI Specialists) - PERFECT MATCH!

Team Members:
  - Alice (Frontend, Lvl 3) - PyQt6 expert
  - Bob (Backend, Lvl 4) - Export & caching
  - Ian (Integration, Lvl 3) - Database workflows
  - Quinn (Quality, Lvl 2) - Testing

Team Synergy: 92% (High)
Pattern Reuse: 12 relevant patterns available
Estimated Time: 28 hours (was 40 hours for new team)
Speedup: 1.4x faster than baseline
Confidence: 95%
```

## üåê Multi-Team Deployment (Future)

### Scenario: Running 3 Projects in Parallel

```
USER HAS 15 TERMINALS AVAILABLE
(5 terminals per project √ó 3 projects)

Project 1: Music Library (Python GUI)
  Team A: Alice, Bob, Ian, Quinn
  Terminals: 1-5

Project 2: E-commerce Site (Web App)
  Team B: React-Rachel, API-Andy, DevOps-Dan, Test-Tina
  Terminals: 6-10

Project 3: Data Pipeline (ETL)
  Team C: Data-Dave, DB-Diana, Flow-Fred, Valid-Vicky
  Terminals: 11-15

BRAIN DASHBOARD (Terminal 0):
  - Monitors all 3 teams
  - Handles merges for all projects
  - Reallocates workers if needed
  - Resolves cross-project blockers
```

### Cross-Team Communication
```yaml
Scenario: Teams need same utility function

Team A discovers: "Amazing JSON validator pattern!"

Brain: "Broadcasting to all teams..."

Team B: "Thanks! Integrating JSON validator"
Team C: "Perfect timing, needed this!"

Pattern added to: ~/.claude-workers/shared/patterns/json-validator.md

All teams benefit instantly!
```
