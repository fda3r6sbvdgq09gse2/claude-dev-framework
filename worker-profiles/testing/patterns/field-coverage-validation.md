# Field Coverage Validation Testing

**Origin:** Book Cataloger - Sprint 3
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Type:** Testing Strategy
**Worker:** Testing Specialist

## Context

"World-class" enrichment is subjective without metrics. We need measurable quality standards to validate that enrichment meets user expectations (BOOKS2.ods level).

## Problem

**Before field coverage validation:**
- "Is enrichment good enough?" → Subjective
- No way to compare API sources
- No regression detection
- Can't set quality targets

**Need:**
- Objective quality measurement
- Comparable across runs
- Regression detection
- Clear targets (Bronze/Silver/Gold)

## Solution

Field coverage percentage as quality metric:

```python
import pytest
from src.core.enrichment_workflow import EnrichmentWorkflow

class TestEnrichmentQuality:
    """Validate enrichment meets quality standards."""

    # Define target fields (what we want to populate)
    TARGET_FIELDS = [
        # Core fields (required)
        'title', 'authors', 'isbn', 'language',

        # Enhanced fields (nice to have)
        'publisher', 'pages', 'publication_date',

        # Translation fields (critical for translations)
        'is_translation', 'original_title', 'original_language',
        'translator', 'romanized_title',

        # Cover image
        'cover_url'
    ]

    # Quality tiers
    BRONZE_COVERAGE = 0.60  # 60% - Acceptable
    SILVER_COVERAGE = 0.75  # 75% - Good
    GOLD_COVERAGE = 0.90    # 90% - Excellent

    @pytest.mark.slow
    def test_art_of_war_field_coverage(self):
        """Art of War: Validate Bronze tier coverage (60%+)."""
        workflow = EnrichmentWorkflow()
        books = workflow.enrich_isbns(['9780981162614'])

        book = books[0]
        coverage = self._calculate_coverage(book, self.TARGET_FIELDS)

        print(f"\nArt of War Coverage: {coverage:.1%}")
        print(f"Fields filled: {self._count_filled(book, self.TARGET_FIELDS)}/{len(self.TARGET_FIELDS)}")
        print(f"Missing fields: {self._list_missing(book, self.TARGET_FIELDS)}")

        assert coverage >= self.BRONZE_COVERAGE, \
            f"Coverage {coverage:.1%} below Bronze tier ({self.BRONZE_COVERAGE:.1%})"

    @pytest.mark.slow

        assert coverage >= self.BRONZE_COVERAGE, \

    @pytest.mark.slow

        workflow = EnrichmentWorkflow()

        translation_fields = ['is_translation', 'original_language', 'translator']

        for book in books:
            if book.get('is_translation'):
                coverage = self._calculate_coverage(book, translation_fields)

                assert coverage >= 0.66, \
                    f"Translation missing critical fields: {self._list_missing(book, translation_fields)}"

    @pytest.mark.slow
    def test_english_original_not_translation(self):

        workflow = EnrichmentWorkflow()
        books = workflow.enrich_isbns(['9780345391803'])  # Hitchhiker's Guide

        book = books[0]

        # Must have is_translation field
        assert 'is_translation' in book

        # Must be False for English original
        assert book['is_translation'] is False, \
            "English original incorrectly marked as translation"

    def _calculate_coverage(self, book: Dict, target_fields: List[str]) -> float:
        """Calculate field coverage percentage."""
        filled = self._count_filled(book, target_fields)
        return filled / len(target_fields)

    def _count_filled(self, book: Dict, target_fields: List[str]) -> int:
        """Count non-empty fields."""
        filled = 0
        for field in target_fields:
            value = book.get(field)
            # Check if field has meaningful value
            if value is not None and value != '' and value != []:
                filled += 1
        return filled

    def _list_missing(self, book: Dict, target_fields: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        """List missing or empty fields."""
        missing = []
        for field in target_fields:
            value = book.get(field)
            if value is None or value == '' or value == []:
                missing.append(field)
        return missing


@pytest.mark.slow
def test_batch_coverage_statistics():
    """Batch test: Calculate average coverage across multiple books."""
    workflow = EnrichmentWorkflow()

    test_isbns = [
        '9780981162614',  # Art of War
        '9780140442106',  # Seneca
        '9780345391803',  # Hitchhiker's Guide
        # Add more test ISBNs...
    ]

    books = workflow.enrich_isbns(test_isbns)

    coverages = []
    for book in books:
        coverage = _calculate_coverage(book, TARGET_FIELDS)
        coverages.append(coverage)

    avg_coverage = sum(coverages) / len(coverages)
    min_coverage = min(coverages)
    max_coverage = max(coverages)

    print(f"\nBatch Coverage Statistics:")
    print(f"  Average: {avg_coverage:.1%}")
    print(f"  Min: {min_coverage:.1%}")
    print(f"  Max: {max_coverage:.1%}")

    assert avg_coverage >= 0.60, "Average coverage below Bronze tier"
```

## Usage

**Run field coverage tests:**
```bash
# Run all slow tests (requires real API access)
pytest -m slow

# Run specific coverage test
pytest tests/integration/test_world_class_enrichment.py::test_art_of_war_field_coverage -v

# Skip slow tests in CI
pytest -m "not slow"
```

**Interpret results:**
```
Art of War Coverage: 73%
Fields filled: 11/15
Missing fields: ['romanized_title', 'publication_date', 'translator', 'cover_url']

✅ PASS - Coverage 73% meets Bronze tier (60%+)
```

**Track coverage over time:**
```python
# Store coverage in database
coverage_log = {
    'date': '2025-10-10',
    'isbn': '9780981162614',
    'coverage': 0.73,
    'filled_fields': 11,
    'total_fields': 15,
    'missing': ['romanized_title', 'publication_date', 'translator', 'cover_url'],
    'api_version': 'v1.3'
}

# Compare with previous run
if coverage < previous_coverage:
    raise Exception("Coverage regression detected!")
```

## Testing

The pattern IS the testing strategy. Meta-tests for the pattern:

```python
def test_coverage_calculation():
    """Test coverage calculation logic."""
    book = {
        'title': 'Test',
        'authors': ['Author'],
        'isbn': '1234567890',
        'publisher': None,  # Missing
        'pages': 0  # Empty
    }

    target_fields = ['title', 'authors', 'isbn', 'publisher', 'pages']

    coverage = _calculate_coverage(book, target_fields)
    assert coverage == 0.6  # 3/5 fields filled

def test_missing_fields_detection():
    """Test missing field detection."""
    book = {'title': 'Test'}
    target_fields = ['title', 'author', 'isbn']

    missing = _list_missing(book, target_fields)
    assert missing == ['author', 'isbn']
```

## Lessons

- **Coverage % is measurable**: Clear metric vs subjective "good enough"
- **Tiers provide targets**: Bronze (60%), Silver (75%), Gold (90%)
- **Missing fields guide improvement**: Know exactly what to fix
- **Regression detection**: Coverage should never decrease
- **Translation-specific validation**: Different fields matter for translations
- **Batch statistics reveal trends**: Average coverage more meaningful than single book

## Reusable For

- Any data enrichment validation
- API quality comparison (which API provides more fields?)
- ETL pipeline validation
- Data completeness monitoring
- Quality regression detection
- User-facing quality metrics

## Quality Tiers

**Bronze (60%+ coverage):**
- Acceptable for personal use
- Core fields present
- Some gaps in enhanced fields

**Silver (75%+ coverage):**
- Good for sharing/publishing
- Most fields present
- Rare gaps in optional fields

**Gold (90%+ coverage):**
- Excellent, publication-quality
- Nearly complete data
- Only obscure fields missing

## Performance

- **Fast**: Coverage calculation < 1ms per book
- **No external calls**: Pure data validation
- **Cacheable**: Store coverage with enriched data
- **Trend analysis**: Track over time to detect regressions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Field weighting**: Some fields more important than others
2. **Category-specific targets**: Fiction vs non-fiction different requirements
3. **Visual dashboard**: Graph coverage over time
4. **Automated alerts**: Email if coverage drops below threshold
5. **Field-level tracking**: Which APIs provide which fields?
