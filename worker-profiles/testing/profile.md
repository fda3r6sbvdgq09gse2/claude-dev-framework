## Learning Goals

- [ ] Property-based testing (Hypothesis)
- [ ] Performance testing (pytest-benchmark)
- [ ] Load testing (locust)
- [ ] Mutation testing (mutmut)
- [ ] Contract testing (Pact)
- [ ] Visual regression testing

---

## Collaboration Style

**With Backend Worker:**
- Creates API stubs before implementation
- Provides integration test structure
- Validates API contracts

**With Frontend Worker:**
- PyQt6 UI testing (pytest-qt)
- User interaction validation
- Visual component tests

**With Integration Worker:**
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Data pipeline validation
- Component integration tests

---

## Code Standards

### Test Structure
```python
"""Test module docstring."""

import pytest
from src.module import MyClass

@pytest.fixture
def my_instance():
    """Fixture docstring."""
    return MyClass()

def test_basic_functionality(my_instance):
    """Test basic functionality."""
    result = my_instance.method()
    assert result == expected

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_api_integration():
    """Test requiring external API (slow)."""
    # Real API call here
    pass
```

### Integration Test Pattern
```python
def test_end_to_end_workflow():
    """Test complete workflow from start to finish."""
    # Setup
    workflow = MyWorkflow()

    # Execute
    result = workflow.execute(input_data)

    # Validate
    assert result.status == "success"
    assert result.data is not None
    assert len(result.errors) == 0
```

---

## Performance Notes

- **Typical task time:** 30-60 min per test module
- **Test writing speed:** ~20-30 tests per hour
- **Coverage focus:** Aim for 85%+ critical path coverage
- **Test run time:** Fast tests < 1s, slow tests marked

---

## Reusable Components Built

1. **Language Registry Tests** - Comprehensive singleton testing
2. **Integration Workflow Tests** - End-to-end validation
3. **Field Coverage Validation** - Quality measurement
4. **API Stub Pattern** - Test-first development
5. **pytest Configuration** - Marker system

**Next project:** Test patterns reusable for any Python project!

---

## Test Strategy Principles

1. **Fast feedback first:** Unit tests run in < 1 second
2. **Separate slow tests:** Use @pytest.mark.slow for API/IO tests
3. **Integration tests validate workflows:** Not just unit tests
4. **Measurable quality:** Coverage %, field completion %
5. **Stub-first development:** Tests ready before implementation

---

## Test Organization

```
tests/
├── unit/                    # Fast, isolated tests
│   ├── test_registry.py
│   └── test_detector.py
├── integration/             # Multi-component tests
│   ├── test_workflow.py
│   └── test_api.py
└── slow/                    # Tests requiring external resources
    └── test_real_apis.py
```

---

## pytest Markers

```ini
[tool:pytest]
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (real API calls, IO)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    unit: marks tests as unit tests
```

**Usage:**
```bash
pytest              # All tests
pytest -m "not slow"  # Skip slow tests
pytest -m integration # Only integration tests
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis
- Performance benchmarks
- Visual regression tests (PyQt6 screenshots)

### Long-term (Next Project)
- Contract testing for APIs
- Load testing for scalability
- Mutation testing for test quality

---

## Notes for Brain

**Assign to Testing when:**
- New components need test coverage
- Integration testing required
- Quality validation needed
- Test strategy/organization

**Average throughput:**
- Unit test module: 30-45 min
- Integration test module: 45-60 min
- Test strategy document: 30 min

**Dependencies:** Needs code from other workers to test.

**Last updated:** 2025-10-10 (Sprint 4 completed)
**Next sprint:** TBD (possibly EnrichmentOrchestrator testing or Translation metadata fields)
