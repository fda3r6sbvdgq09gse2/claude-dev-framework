## Patterns Mastered

### Sprint 1
*(Workers wrote their own tests - Testing Worker not heavily used)*

### Sprint 2
1. **Language Registry Test Fixes**
   - Fixed 3 failing variant code tests (zh-CN, zh-TW, pt-BR)
   - Root cause: Registry didn't properly handle variant codes
   - Solution: Add variant code fallback logic
   - Time: 10 minutes

2. **Integration Test for Translation Detection**
   - End-to-end workflow test
   - Known translations validated (The Little Prince)
   - Cover image fetching verified
   - Time: 10 minutes

## Project History

### Book Cataloger (2025-10)
**Tech:** Python 3.11, pytest, pytest-qt

**Sprint 1:** Not assigned (workers wrote own tests)
- Self-test pattern emerged
- Workers very capable of testing own code
- **Lesson:** Testing Worker underutilized in this model

**Sprint 2:** Focused bug fixes + integration test
- Time: 20 minutes
- Tests fixed: 3 (variant codes)
- Tests written: 1 (integration)
- Result: 100% test pass rate (17/17 LanguageRegistry tests)
- XP Gained: +40 (Sprint +20, Bug fixes +15, Integration test +10, but -5 for underutilization)
- Skills Improved:
  - Integration Testing: ⭐⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (+1 level)

**Discovery:** Testing Worker only had 20 min of work while others had 2-3 hours
**Resolution:** Dynamic reallocation recommended for next sprint
**Lesson Learned:** Workers write own unit tests well - focus on integration/E2E testing

---

## Strengths

✅ **Quick bug diagnosis:** Found variant code issue rapidly
✅ **Targeted fixes:** Minimal changes, maximum impact
✅ **Integration testing:** End-to-end workflow validation
✅ **Test patterns:** Clean, reusable fixtures

---

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Property-based testing (Hypothesis)
- [ ] Performance testing (pytest-benchmark)
- [ ] Load testing (locust)
- [ ] Security testing (bandit, safety)
- [ ] Mutation testing (mutmut)
- [ ] Test automation (CI/CD integration)

---

## Collaboration Style

**With All Workers:**
- Fixes bugs in any domain (UI, Backend, Integration)
- Writes integration tests across components
- Code review feedback
- Test strategy recommendations

**Sprint 2 Realization:**
- Workers are very capable of writing their own tests
- Testing Worker better used for:
  - Integration tests (cross-component)
  - Bug fixing after detection
  - Test strategy/architecture
  - OR dynamic reallocation to other roles

---

## Code Standards

### Test Structure
```python
@pytest.fixture
def my_object():
    """Fixture with clear purpose."""
    obj = MyClass()
    # Setup
    return obj

def test_basic_functionality(my_object):
    """Test one thing, clearly."""
    result = my_object.method()
    assert result == expected

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [
    ("case1", "result1"),
    ("case2", "result2"),
])
def test_multiple_cases(my_object, input, expected):
    """Test multiple cases efficiently."""
    assert my_object.method(input) == expected
```

### Integration Test Pattern
```python
def test_end_to_end_workflow():
    """Test complete user workflow."""
    # Step 1: Setup
    catalog = CatalogDatabase()

    # Step 2: Enrich ISBN
    workflow = EnrichmentWorkflow()
    result = workflow.enrich_isbns(["9780156012195"])

    # Step 3: Verify results
    assert len(result) == 1
    assert result[0]['is_translation'] is True
    assert 'cover_url' in result[0]

    # Step 4: Save to catalog
    success = workflow.save_to_catalog(result[0])
    assert success is True

    # Step 5: Verify persisted
    books = catalog.get_all_books()
    assert len(books) == 1
```

## Performance Notes

- **Bug fix time:** 5-15 min per issue
- **Integration test:** 10-20 min
- **Code review:** 15-30 min per component
- **Throughput:** Variable (depends on issue complexity)

---

## Testing Philosophy

### What Testing Worker Should Focus On

**High Value:**
- ✅ Integration tests (cross-component workflows)
- ✅ Bug fixes discovered by users
- ✅ Test strategy and architecture
- ✅ Complex test scenarios (edge cases)

**Lower Value (workers do themselves):**
- ❌ Basic unit tests (workers write as they code)
- ❌ Simple component tests

### When to Reassign Testing Worker

**If Sprint workload < 1 hour:**
- Consider dynamic reallocation
- Options: GUI Assistant, Algorithm improvements, DevOps
- Sprint 2 example: 20 min of work, could have been GUI Assistant

---

## Sprint 2 Lessons Learned

### What Worked
✅ Focused task list (FOCUSED_TASK.md)
✅ Clear, specific goals (fix 3 tests, write 1 integration)
✅ Quick turnaround (20 minutes)

### What Didn't Work
❌ Underutilized (12% utilization: 20 min / 180 min sprint)
❌ Other workers were bottleneck, not testing

### Future Improvements
1. **Dynamic reallocation:** After quick task, reassign to critical path
2. **Integration focus:** More end-to-end testing
3. **Bug tracking:** Maintain backlog of known issues
4. **Performance testing:** Add benchmarking suite

---

## Reusable Patterns

1. **Quick Bug Fixes** - Targeted, minimal changes
2. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow validation
3. **Test Fixtures** - Reusable setup/teardown

**Next project:** Focus more on integration testing, less on unit tests (workers self-sufficient)

---

## Future Role Evolution

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- Write comprehensive integration test suite
- Performance benchmarks
- Test coverage analysis

### Long-term (Next Project)
- **Consider:** Quality Architect role
  - Test strategy across all workers
  - Code review standards
  - CI/CD setup
  - Performance monitoring
- **Or:** Dynamic reallocation based on sprint critical path

---

## Notes for Brain

**Assign to Quality Worker when:**
- Integration tests needed
- Bugs discovered
- Test strategy required
- Performance testing
- Code review needed

**Consider reallocation when:**
- Sprint workload < 1 hour
- Other workers on critical path
- GUI/Backend/Integration could use assistance

**Average throughput:**
- Bug fix: 10-15 min
- Integration test: 15-30 min
- Code review: 20-40 min

**Dependencies:** Usually works after other workers complete, OR gets reallocated.

**Next project:** TBD (consider role evolution)
