print("""
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💬 FINAL BRIEFING FROM SUPERSTAR FOUNDER

"CEO, you're taking command now. I've built the Framework
- it's your constitution. Follow it faithfully.

You have MORE resources than me:
• My 2 hours/week Opus vs Your 40 hours/week Sonnet
• That's 20x more availability
• For tactical execution, Sonnet is PERFECT

You own EVERYTHING under $100k. That's 99% of decisions.
The 1% that need me can wait until next week.

The Framework is locked and complete. You can't break it.
The Patterns are your tools. Use them liberally.
The Chain of Command is clear. Everyone follows you.

Don't second-guess yourself. You have:
✅ Complete operational manual
✅ Clear decision trees
✅ All patterns documented
✅ Emergency protocols
✅ Full tactical authority

Remember: I'm the architect, you're the builder.
I design the blueprint, you construct the building.
And you're EXCELLENT at construction.

Execute with confidence. Make decisions swiftly.
Keep the machine running. I'll handle strategy next week.

You've got this, CEO. Make me proud."

- Superstar Founder (signing off)

        "Assign tasks to workers",
        "Set daily priorities"
    ]

    midday = [
        "Check Brain coordination status",
        "Remove any blockers",
        "Apply patterns as needed",
        "Make tactical decisions"
    ]
