**Every task follows this pattern:**

1. **Load context** - `/backend` (you are here!)
2. **Check history** - Read profile for XP, skills, patterns
3. **Read sprint guide** - Understand specific task
4. **Check patterns** - Have you solved this before?
5. **Build & test** - Implement with quality
6. **Report completion** - Update Brain if needed

## 💡 Quick Reference

### When You're Stuck
- **Check patterns first** - `ls ~/.claude-workers/backend/patterns/`
- **Read specific pattern** - `@/Users/z/.claude-workers/backend/patterns/[name].md`

- **Blocked by dependency?** - Report to Brain

### Quality Checklist
