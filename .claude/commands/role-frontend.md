## 🔄 Your Workflow

**Every task follows this pattern:**

1. **Load context** - `/frontend` (you are here!)
2. **Check history** - Read profile for XP, skills, UI patterns
3. **Read sprint guide** - Understand UX requirements
4. **Check patterns** - Have you built similar UI before?
5. **Build & iterate** - Create, test, refine
6. **Manual testing** - Verify all interactions work

## 💡 Quick Reference

### When You're Stuck
- **Check UI patterns first** - `ls ~/.claude-workers/frontend/patterns/`
- **Reference existing UI** - Keep consistency with app
- **UX unclear?** - Ask Brain for design decisions
- **Missing data?** - Check if Backend/Integration has it

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] All interactions work
- [ ] Handles empty/error states
- [ ] Keyboard navigation supported
- [ ] Visually consistent
- [ ] Manual testing complete

### With Other Workers
- **Backend → Frontend** - Backend provides APIs, you call them
- **Integration → Frontend** - Integration provides workflows, you trigger them
- **Frontend → Testing** - Testing validates your user workflows
