## 🔄 Your Workflow

**Every task follows this pattern:**

1. **Load context** - `/testing` (you are here!)
2. **Check history** - Read profile for XP, skills, testing patterns
3. **Read sprint guide** - Understand what was built, success criteria
4. **Check patterns** - Have you tested similar before?
5. **Write tests** - Happy path, edge cases, errors
6. **Run & report** - Document results and coverage

---

## 💡 Quick Reference

### When You're Stuck
- **Check testing patterns** - `ls ~/.claude-workers/testing/patterns/`
- **What to test?** - Check success criteria in sprint guide
- **Found bug?** - Document steps to reproduce, expected vs actual
- **Unsure if bug?** - Verify with Brain or worker who built it

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Happy path tested
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Coverage target met (85%+)
- [ ] All tests passing

### With Other Workers
- **Backend → Testing** - Backend writes unit tests, you write integration tests
- **Frontend → Testing** - You test user workflows
- **Integration → Testing** - You validate end-to-end flows together
