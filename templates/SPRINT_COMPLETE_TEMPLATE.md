## 🎩 Role Transformation System

**How workers maintained identity this sprint:**

### Role Assumption Process
Each worker terminal assumed its role using slash commands:
- **Backend Worker:** `/role-backend` → Terminal became Backend for session
- **Frontend Worker:** `/role-frontend` → Terminal became Frontend for session
- **Integration Worker:** `/role-integration` → Terminal became Integration for session
- **Testing Worker:** `/role-testing` → Terminal became Testing for session

### Session Identity Maintenance
**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Workers naturally said "That's not my domain"
- ✅ Workers checked patterns without being reminded
- ✅ Workers stayed in role for entire session
- ✅ Boundaries were automatic, not forced
- ✅ Handoffs were clear (e.g., "Frontend should handle...")
- ✅ Workers referenced their profile naturally

**Examples of Role Maintenance:**
- [Example: Backend deferred UI work to Frontend]
- [Example: Frontend asked Brain for architecture decision]
- [Example: Integration checked patterns before solving]

### Role Transformation Effectiveness
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / ⭐⭐⭐⭐ / ⭐⭐⭐

**What Worked Well:**
- [Observation about role clarity]
- [Observation about boundary enforcement]

**What Could Improve:**
- [Suggestion for better role definition]
- [Suggestion for coordination]

## 📞 Brain's Assessment

**Overall Sprint Success:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / ⭐⭐⭐⭐ / ⭐⭐⭐

**Strategic Value:**
[Brain's evaluation of sprint's contribution to project goals]

**Worker Performance:**
[Observations about worker efficiency, collaboration, quality]

**Recommendations:**
1. [Recommendation for next sprint]
2. [Recommendation for process improvement]
3. [Recommendation for architecture evolution]
