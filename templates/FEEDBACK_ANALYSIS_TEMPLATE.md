## 🚀 Proposed Sprint Sequence

### Recommended Path

**Phase 1:** Sprint [NUMBER]A ([X hours])
- Fix critical bugs and UI polish
- Workers use slash commands to assume roles:
  - `/role-backend` → Backend Worker session
  - `/role-frontend` → Frontend Worker session
- User tests and validates
- Quick wins build momentum

**Phase 2:** Brain planning ([Y hours])
- Brain uses `/role-brain` to assume coordinator role
- Write ADRs for architectural decisions
- User reviews and approves architecture
- Create Sprint [NUMBER]B launch guide with worker prompts

**Phase 3:** Sprint [NUMBER]B ([Z hours])
- Workers reassume roles with slash commands
- Implement data model changes
- Database migrations
- User tests comprehensive changes

**Role Transformation System:**
Each terminal assumes worker identity for entire session:
- Run `/role-backend` → Terminal IS Backend Worker until `exit`
- Run `/role-frontend` → Terminal IS Frontend Worker until `exit`
- Run `/role-brain` → Terminal IS Brain until `exit`
