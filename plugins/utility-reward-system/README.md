Example agent output with rewards:
```
[BACKEND-SONNET]: API integration complete.

✅ Task Complete
📊 XP Earned: +30 (Complex task)
⭐ Current Level: 2 (385/500 XP to Level 3)
🏆 Achievement Unlocked: "API Master" (10+ integrations)

Next milestone: 115 XP to Level 3
```

## 🔌 Integration with Agents

### Without Reward System
```markdown
---
name: backend
description: Backend specialist
---

Simple agent, just does the work.
```

### With Reward System
```markdown
---
name: backend
description: Backend specialist
rewards: enabled
---

Agent tracks XP, displays progress, unlocks achievements.

At end of tasks:
[BACKEND]: Task complete. +30 XP earned!
```

**The core agent definition doesn't change!**
Reward system is a runtime enhancement.

---

## 📝 API for Custom Tracking

If you want to build custom tools:

```python
from claude_rewards import RewardTracker

tracker = RewardTracker()

# Award XP
tracker.award_xp(agent="backend", amount=30, reason="API integration")

# Check level
level = tracker.get_level("backend")  # Returns: 2

# Get achievements
achievements = tracker.get_achievements("backend")

# Check progress
progress = tracker.get_progress("backend")
# Returns: {xp: 385, level: 2, next_level_xp: 500, percentage: 77}
```

---

## 🚫 Disabling Rewards

### Per Agent
```markdown
---
name: backend
rewards: disabled
---
```

### Per Project
```bash
# In .claude/config
{
  "rewards": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### Global Disable
```bash
/plugin uninstall reward-system
```

## 🎯 Philosophy

### Why Gamification Works
- **Visible Progress**: See agent improvement
- **Goal Setting**: Clear targets (next level, achievement)
- **Engagement**: Makes development more fun
- **Metrics**: Quantifies value delivered
- **Team Spirit**: Creates agent personalities

### Why It's Optional
- **Not for Everyone**: Some prefer minimalism
- **Flexibility**: Choose your style
- **No Lock-In**: Works with or without
- **Professional Settings**: May not fit company culture
