# Framework Patterns Extracted - October 12, 2025
*Patterns discovered during framework infrastructure build*

## üéØ Pattern 1: Model-Aware Role Architecture

### Problem
Different AI models have different capabilities and costs. How do we optimally match models to roles while maintaining flexibility?

### Solution
**Role + Model = Unique Capability**

```yaml
pattern: Model-Aware Roles
structure:
  role_definition: Abstract responsibilities
  model_detection: Automatic capability check
  graceful_fallback: Opus ‚Üí Sonnet ‚Üí Haiku
  signature_system: [ROLE-MODEL] identification

implementation:
  /role-ceo:
    if opus: Full strategic vision
    if sonnet: CEO Lite tactical mode
    if haiku: Reject, insufficient

  /role-brain:
    always: Sonnet only
    reason: Optimal for coordination
```

### Reusability
- Any project with multiple AI workers
- Model-agnostic (works with GPT, Gemini, etc)
- Future-proof for new models

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üéØ Pattern 2: Single Source of Truth Architecture

### Problem
Configuration drift across multiple files leads to inconsistencies and maintenance nightmares.

### Solution
**One Truth, Many References**

```yaml
pattern: Single Source Registry
structure:
  registry_files:
    - CURRENT_SPRINT.md (sprint status)
    - TEMPORAL_AWARENESS.md (time)
    - MODEL_CAPABILITIES_REGISTRY.md (models)
    - TOKEN_ECONOMICS_REGISTRY.md (costs)
    - ACCOUNT_REGISTRY.md (billing)

  propagation:
    - All role commands reference registries
    - No hardcoded values
    - Update scripts propagate changes

example:
  instead_of: "Sprint 6B" hardcoded everywhere
  use: Reference CURRENT_SPRINT.md
  benefit: Change once, updates everywhere
```

### Reusability
- Any multi-component system
- Configuration management
- Enterprise applications

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üéØ Pattern 3: External Time Authority

### Problem
LLMs have no internal clock and constantly forget or confuse dates, leading to temporal drift.

### Solution
**External Clock Reference**

```python
pattern: External Time Source
implementation:
  # Never trust LLM memory for time
  def get_real_time():
      return datetime.datetime.now()  # System clock

  # Always check at session start
  def load_context():
      current_time = get_real_time()
      print(f"Today is {current_time}")

  # Embed in all outputs
  signature = f"[ROLE @ {timestamp}]: Output..."
```

### Reusability
- Any LLM application
- Audit trails
- Time-sensitive operations

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üéØ Pattern 4: Token Economics Tracking

### Problem
AI API costs can spiral out of control without visibility and tracking.

### Solution
**Comprehensive Usage Analytics**

```yaml
pattern: Token Economics Platform
components:
  tracking:
    - Log every session
    - Calculate API equivalent cost
    - Compare to subscription
    - Track ROI

  optimization:
    - Model selection matrix
    - Task-to-model mapping
    - Efficiency targets
    - Budget alerts

  reporting:
    daily: Cost vs value
    weekly: ROI analysis
    monthly: Optimization opportunities

formula:
  roi = value_delivered / tokens_used
  efficiency = patterns_extracted / cost
```

### Reusability
- Any AI-assisted development
- Cost-conscious projects
- Enterprise deployments

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üéØ Pattern 5: Supercharge Power-Up System

### Problem
Sometimes you need maximum AI capability for critical problems, but can't afford it constantly.

### Solution
**Temporary Power Boost**

```yaml
pattern: Supercharge Protocol
concept: Like Mario's mushroom - temporary power
mechanics:
  activation:
    - CEO approves
    - Brain schedules
    - Worker activates
    - Timer starts (60 min max)

  during:
    - Opus capabilities
    - Clear focus
    - Pattern extraction required

  deactivation:
    - Automatic on timer
    - Return to normal model
    - Cooldown period (24h)

economics:
  cost: $40/hour premium
  breakeven: Must save 4+ hours
  typical_roi: 10-20x
```

### Reusability
- Critical problem solving
- Emergency response
- Innovation sprints
- Breakthrough moments

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üéØ Pattern 6: Role Distinction Clarity

### Problem
Overlapping responsibilities between roles leads to confusion and inefficiency.

### Solution
**Clear Separation of Concerns**

```yaml
pattern: Role Boundaries
principle: Different levels, different purposes

CEO:
  level: Framework/Enterprise
  scope: Multi-project
  horizon: 1-10 years
  model: Opus primary

Brain:
  level: Project
  scope: Single project
  horizon: 1-4 weeks
  model: Sonnet only

Workers:
  level: Implementation
  scope: Specific tasks
  horizon: 1-3 days
  model: Sonnet default

key: They don't overlap, they complement
```

### Reusability
- Team organization
- Responsibility matrices
- Hierarchical systems

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üéØ Pattern 7: XP and Leveling System

### Problem
No visibility into AI worker progression and skill development.

### Solution
**Gamified Progress Tracking**

```yaml
pattern: Worker Leveling
structure:
  profile:
    - Current level
    - XP points
    - Achievements
    - Skills ratings
    - Signature moves

  progression:
    - XP for completed tasks
    - Level thresholds
    - Skill unlocks
    - Achievement badges

  motivation:
    - Clear progress
    - Tangible goals
    - Skill recognition
    - Growth tracking
```

### Reusability
- Any skill-based system
- Team development
- Learning platforms

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üéØ Pattern 8: Graceful Degradation

### Problem
Premium resources (like Opus) aren't always available.

### Solution
**Fallback Chains**

```yaml
pattern: Graceful Degradation
principle: Best available, not all-or-nothing

chain:
  1. Try optimal (Opus)
  2. Fall to good (Sonnet)
  3. Fall to adequate (Haiku)
  4. Inform user of degradation

implementation:
  CEO ‚Üí CEO Lite ‚Üí Defer
  Supercharge ‚Üí Normal ‚Üí Wait
  Premium ‚Üí Standard ‚Üí Basic

key: System continues functioning at reduced capability
```

### Reusability
- Resource-constrained systems
- High-availability requirements
- Cost optimization

### Effectiveness: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
